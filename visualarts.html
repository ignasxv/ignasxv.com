									<h3><a href="#" id="startShow">Visual Arts and why I do it</a></h3>
									<p> As a child I was always disturbed by my own imagination, I would interpret what I see in a way that contradicted objective reality, I remember perceiving shadows of objects as monsters. Growing up I became interested in the subject of optical illusions and perception, taking great inspiration from artist Michael Murphy, I realized perception does not only affect our visual comprehension but also our conceptual understanding of society. 
										Perception is mostly involuntary, influenced by our abstract knowledge of the world and merely our backgrounds and experiences. Biased perception can seriously undermine our control of prejudice and perpetuate negative stereotypes towards certain demographics. 
										By using visual-optical techniques, I love creating artworks attempting to show how our perception can be biased, resulting a distorted interpretation of objective reality.

									<p>As you walk in, you immediately see a projection of three equal shadows on the suspended sheet. 
										Normally equal shadows are produced if the objects are similar; You unconsciously form an opinion 
										that the objects behind the shadows are equal, later to realize they are not. This is visual perception 
										bias reflecting on the underestimated inequalities in various aspects of life such as race, gender, etc.
										 Our existing perception of equality in the society can be an illusion-The illusion of equality

										<p>He had closed his medical practice under Nazi pressure and later was arrested and deported. 
											"He has already died". This was only two weeks after he arrived in the concentration camp. 
											Dr. Joachim is just one of the six million victims of the systematic persecuting and murder 
											of Jews by the Nazis in WWII, the Holocaust. The piece brings up the concept of perception bias,
											 stereotypes and its immense effect which have left a million souls unsettled and still prevails
											  in the contemporary society
